ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system suggests movies ðŸŽ¥ similar to a user-provided movie title by analyzing metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and director.

The dataset consists of 4,800 movies, including information such as title, genres, keywords, cast, and director. The dataset was preprocessed to remove missing values and to combine relevant textual features into a single "features" column for similarity calculations. The core of this project involves calculating similarities between movies using the cosine similarity technique. ðŸ“Š

To run this project locally, clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Recommendations.git and navigate to the project directory. Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. After setting up, you can run the Jupyter notebook Movie Recommendations.ipynb to explore the code and make movie recommendations. ðŸš€

The main steps involve loading and preparing the dataset, combining relevant columns, and calculating similarities using Scikit-learn's CountVectorizer and cosine_similarity functions. Finally, the system provides a list of movies similar to a given title, enhancing user engagement through personalized recommendations. ðŸŽ¯

The project uses Python, Pandas for data manipulation, and Scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity calculations, all developed interactively in a Jupyter Notebook.
